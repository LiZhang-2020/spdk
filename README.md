# rdma-snap Library

This is the userspace library for developing SNAP (Software-defined Network Accelerated Processing)
based applications on Linux RDMA subsystem.
Specifically this contains the userspace library for the following device emulation applications:
1. NVMe SNAP
2. VirtIO-blk SNAP
3. VirtIO-net SNAP

This library will assist in common tasks when interacting with the emulating hardware in order to
present a SNAP device (emulated PCI device) to an external host or a VM (e.g. by using SoC Smart NIC).
