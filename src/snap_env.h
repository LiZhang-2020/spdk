/*
 * SNAP RPC feature request
 *
 * Why we need this?
 *
 *  1.	We have a lot of different parameters around SNAP startup and several
 *      values per parameter (/etc/default/mlnx_snap).
 *      Some parameters affect performance, so we need to save them as part of the SNAP Performance report.
 *
 *  2.	On some cases, like:
 *      #SOME_PARAMETER=0
 *      SOME_PARAMETER=0
 *      For SNAP controller this means different behavior and itâ€™s very confusing.
 *      So, parameters must be collected in runtime after controller initialization.
 *
 *  3.	This will be useful during debugging with another team or customer.
